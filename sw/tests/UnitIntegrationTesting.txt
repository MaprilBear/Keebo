Unit and integration tests for the various board modules are provided below:

Before proceeding to the tests below, we first checked whether any PCB shorts exist. 

1. Solder and test the power circuit (LDO regulator), to ensure it is converting the input voltage to the required 3.3V. Can initially provide input voltage using a DC power supply.

2. Solder the switching IC.

3. Solder battery connector & micro-USB connector. Verify that micro USB provides 5V to the switching IC. 

4. Test the power switching IC to ensure it can i) switch between between input voltages supplied by the batteries and the USB, and ii) provide a stable output voltage in battery-operated mode in situations where USB power is disconnected.

5. Solder TM4C123 QFP IC.

6. Solder and test one row of switches - we do not want to solder all of the switches in case we need to make a revision.

7. Solder and test bluetooth IC.

8. Based on how steps 1-7 proceed, solder the remaining switches and test the whole system.


The order of steps 1-7 may change.
